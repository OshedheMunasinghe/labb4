# Vue 3 - PWA Laboratory 4
This was require from my school work. Mission as an application developer is to build Vue from web to PWA. PWA has to connect to github.io . 
This laboratory was required to use API json and bootstrap. Here is the website: https://oshedhemunasinghe.github.io/#/ 

_For you information: this site is going down soon maybe in August. The site is going to convert to portfoilo ;) Stay tuned_
